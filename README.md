A scrabble training game

I made this game primarily to help with my own scrabble performance. Though, I'd love it if someone else found it useful. There are 6 primary features:

1) **Free Play Mode:** Practice Scrabble at your own pace. Place words on the board and get instant feedback on your play quality. You have no opponent in this gameplay. This is designed purely to help you be better at playing the most optimal word possible for scoring the most points.
2) **Play Computer:** Play against a computer opponent at your chosen difficulty level. You can tailor difficulty by the computer's ability to pick the highest scoring word and by its defensiveness of high-value tiles. In both free play mode and computer mode you have an "efficiency score" which is a measure of how close your plays are to optimal. It's calculated as:(Your Points Scored ÷ Best Possible Points) × 100%. You also have the option to see a measure of your rack balancing which will appear at bottom of screen when selected in computer play mode. More details on how this is calculated in about section.
3) **Hook Words:** Practice hook words. In other words, practice extending a word already on the board by adding letters before or after the word to make a new word.
4) **Bingo Practice:** Practice finding 7 and 8-letter words that use all your tiles for the 50-point bingo bonus.
5) **Anagram Practice:** Practice solving anagrams.
6) **Vocabulary Mode:** Expand your Scrabble vocabulary by learning new words.
